**Portfolio**

**About**
This application is a portfolio of work for Chloe Yu.  I created this website using HTML and CSS in order to showcase the work that I have completed and the projects that I am working on.  I plan on updating the website as the class continues.

**Challenges**
I had a lot of fun working on the flexboxes for this page!  It was a hassle trying to figure out how many containers I needed -- did I need one to contain all of the sections or just small flexboxes within each section? Should I use a static positioning for the titles or incorporate them into the flex?  In the future, I hope to implement a drop down navigation menu with a hamburger icon for mobile versions.

**Motivation**
I created this portfolio to showcase my projects for future employers to see and to have a place where I can easily find pages I worked on in a organized fashion.  It also was a fun exercise in working with flexbox and images.
